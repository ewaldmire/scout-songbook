\textbf{Characters:} Alex, Jamie, Scout Leader, Narrator

\medskip

\textit{Scene: A park with an imaginary bench.}

\medskip

\textbf{Narrator:} Alex and Jamie are walking through the park when they spot an invisible bench.

\medskip

\textbf{Alex:} Look! There’s a bench right here!  

\textbf{Jamie:} I don’t see anything.  

\textbf{Alex:} That’s because it’s invisible! You just have to sit down.  

\textbf{Jamie:} (hesitant) Are you sure it’s safe?  

\textbf{Scout Leader:} (smiling) Remember, being a scout means using your imagination—and being careful at the same time.  

\medskip

\textbf{Alex:} Watch this! (sits carefully on the invisible bench)  

\textbf{Jamie:} (pretends to sit) Whoa! I’m sitting too!  

\textbf{Scout Leader:} Excellent teamwork! You both found the invisible bench together.  

\medskip

\textbf{Narrator:} And so our scouts learned the power of imagination, and how a little creativity can make any day fun.
