The Skit\\

Scout 1: Hey, Johnny, you're good with first aid. I need your help.\\

Scout 2: OK, what's the problem?\\

Scout 1: When I touch my forehead with my finger, it really hurts. When I push on my jaw, it's also painful. When I press on my stomach, I almost cry. What can it be?\\

(does each thing as he says them, always pushing with the tip of the same finger)\\

(Scout 2 looks in his ears, listens to his heart, has him open his mouth, ...)\\

Scout 2: Man, I don't know. You'd better go see the doctor right away.\\

Scout 1: OK, I'll be right back.\\

(Scout 1 runs offstage and returns right back.)\\

Scout 2: So, what did the doctor say? What's wrong with you?\\

Scout 1: He says I have a broken finger.\\
