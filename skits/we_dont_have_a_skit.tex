The Skit\\

A Scout comes in and looks at the audience. Then he sits on the stage, crying loudly.\\

Then another Scout comes in. The first Scout whispers something to the second and the second one says “Oh no!” He sits down next to the first and starts bawling.\\

A third Scout comes in and the second Scout says “I can’t believe it” and sits down crying loudly.\\

The Scouts keep coming in and doing this until all but one of them is on the stage.\\

The last Scout comes in and says “What is wrong?”\\

One of the crying Scouts answers “We don’t have a skit”.\\
