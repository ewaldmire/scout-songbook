\begin{center}
\textit{[Intro] - sung by leader only}\\
(get melody from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0knM6-8PKI)
\end{center}

\begin{verse}
There's a Quartermaster everybody knows \\
with a song about him... this is how it goes \\
just a little ditty... doesn't mean a thing \\
but when the scouts are marching they love to sing:

\begin{verse}
There are mice, mice... eating all the rice \\
At the store, at the store. \\[0.3cm]
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
There are bowls, bowls ... with big old giant holes \\
At the Quartermaster's store. \\[0.5cm]
\end{verse}

\begin{center}
\textit{[Chorus]}
\end{center}

\begin{verse}
My eyes are dim I can not see \\
I have not brought my specs with me \\
I have not brought my specs with me \\[0.3cm]
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
Mice ... eating all the rice \\
Bowls ... with big old giant holes \\
Tents ... but all the poles are bent \\
Cheese ... that makes you want to sneeze \\
Bread ... harder than your head \\
Beans ... as big as submarines \\
Bugs ... hiding in the jugs \\
Moths ... eating through the cloths \\
Owls ... shredding paper towels \\
Snacks ... left open by the pack \\
Bears ... but no one really cares
\end{verse}
