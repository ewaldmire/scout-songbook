\songtitle{Found a Peanut}
To the tune of “Oh My Darling, Clementine” \\

Found a peanut, found a peanut, found a peanut just now. \\
Just now I found a peanut, found a peanut just now. \\
 \\
Cracked it open, cracked it open, cracked it open just now \\
Just now I cracked it open, cracked it open just now. \\
 \\
It was rotten, it was rotten, it was rotten just now, \\
Just now it was rotten, it was rotten just now. \\
 \\
Ate it anyway \\
Got a stomachache \\
Called the doctor \\
(he) Had me drink soup \\
Took a nap \\
Was a dream \\
Then I woke up \\
Walked to School \\
Found a peanut \\
