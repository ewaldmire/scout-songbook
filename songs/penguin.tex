Have you ever seen a penguin come to tea?\\
When you look at me a penguin you will see:\\

Penguins: Unite! (clap hands over head)\\
Penguins: At Ease! (arms down at side)\\

Right Flipper (flap right arm)\\

Repeat adding one more each time:\\

Left Flipper (flap left arm)\\
Right Foot (flap right foot)\\
Left Foot (flap left food)\\
Nod Your Head (Nod your head)\\
Turn Around (spin in a circle)\\
Tongue Out (tonge out while singing)\\

Penguins: Unite! (clap hands over head)\\
Penguins: At Ease! (arms down at side)\\
